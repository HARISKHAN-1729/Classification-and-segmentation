# Classification-and-segmentation

This repository contains two advanced machine learning projects focusing on classification and semantic segmentation. These notebooks are designed as a comprehensive educational tool for mastering deep learning techniques applied to different machine learning problems.

**Projects**

**Classification Model**
   
The classification model notebook (My_classification_model.ipynb) serves as a detailed educational exercise. It includes a step-by-step approach to developing a deep learning model for image classification tasks. The notebook is structured as a series of problems and solutions, providing insights into both the theoretical and practical aspects of machine learning.

**Key Features:**

- Comprehensive problem statements and solutions
- Usage of PyTorch for model development
- Visualization of results and model performance metrics

**Semantic Segmentation**
   
The semantic segmentation notebook (semanticsegmentation_report and code.ipynb) delves into the advanced topic of segmenting images at the pixel level using deep learning frameworks. This notebook provides a practical guide to implementing semantic segmentation models.

**Key Features:**

- Detailed explanation and implementation of semantic segmentation
- Application of the torchvision and albumentations libraries for data augmentation and model training
- In-depth performance analysis

**Installation**

1. Clone the Repository: Start by cloning the repository to your local machine. Use the following command in your terminal:

```bash

git clone https://github.com/HARISKHAN-1729/Classification-and-segmentation.git
```

2.  Navigate to the Repository Directory: Change your directory to the cloned repository:

```bash
cd Classification-and-segmentation
```

3. Install Dependencies: Install all the required Python libraries listed in requirements.txt. It's recommended to use a virtual environment to avoid conflicts with other packages:

```bash

python -m venv env
source env/bin/activate  # On Windows use `env\Scripts\activate`
pip install -r requirements.txt

```

Launch Jupyter Notebook or Jupyter Lab: Start Jupyter Lab or Notebook to access the notebooks:

```bash

jupyter lab
# Or for Jupyter Notebook:
# jupyter notebook

```
This will open the Jupyter interface in your default web browser, where you can navigate to and open the project notebooks.

With these steps, you'll be prepared to explore and run the machine learning models provided in the notebooks.
