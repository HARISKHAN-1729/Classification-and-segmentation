# Classification-and-segmentation

This repository contains two advanced machine learning projects focusing on classification and semantic segmentation. These notebooks are designed as a comprehensive educational tool for mastering deep learning techniques applied to different machine learning problems.

Projects

Classification Model
   
The classification model notebook (My_classification_model.ipynb) serves as a detailed educational exercise. It includes a step-by-step approach to developing a deep learning model for image classification tasks. The notebook is structured as a series of problems and solutions, providing insights into both the theoretical and practical aspects of machine learning.

Key Features:

- Comprehensive problem statements and solutions
- Usage of PyTorch for model development
- Visualization of results and model performance metrics

Semantic Segmentation
   
The semantic segmentation notebook (semanticsegmentation_report and code.ipynb) delves into the advanced topic of segmenting images at the pixel level using deep learning frameworks. This notebook provides a practical guide to implementing semantic segmentation models.

Key Features:

- Detailed explanation and implementation of semantic segmentation
- Application of the torchvision and albumentations libraries for data augmentation and model training
- In-depth performance analysis
